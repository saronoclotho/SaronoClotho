                        The standardisation of clothing sizes and the various
                        standards adopted by different manufacturers today, make
                        online shopping of clothes unnecessarily complicated. Online
                        customers often find themselves overwhelmed with different
                        sizing options depending on the country, brand, and
                        clothing category, while the fear of poor fitting clothing
                        often discourages online purchases. Further frustration occurs
                        when customers receive online purchased apparel only to
                        find out that it does not properly fit.

                        Driven by the market’s need to evolve conventional online
                        clothes shopping, SaronoClotho offers a novel set of
                        tools and services that aim to redefine the customer’s
                        shopping experience. By employing advanced clothing
                        simulation and 3D body scanning technologies, SaronoClotho
                        will provide its customers with a detailed 3D
                        visualisation of both static and moving avatars that 
                        accurately represent their body shape. These avatars will
                        be virtually dressed in their clothing preference, while
                        visual cues that will indicate the quality of fit
                        (e.g., local tightness and looseness) will also be
                        provided. The users will be able to
                        adjust their avatars to pose in the same way that they
                        would have inside a dressing room and get the actual
                        feel of the clothes' fitting quality.
                        More specifically, our company will provide the
                        following features:
